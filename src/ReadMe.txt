Unfortuantely was not able to create scripts to run test cases in terminal without error, however all test cases pass in any IDE with JUnit working. 

Used Dependencies:
Scanner class in Java is used to obtain input of primitive data types, in this case we used it to obtain a String input from the user for the meal and item IDs for their order. 
Object class is used because in our case since we use inheritance and extend our classes from Menu.java, we indirectly use the Object class.
JUnit dependencies were used to create tests, name the test, as well as the assertions import which allowed us to create the actual comparisons for our tests with expected compared to actual output based on the user input.
